The O directory includes a sample input file for H2OX. The compute_NASA notebook generates cti entries for the species listed the in species_list.dat files. 
The current setup assumes that the species input files are in directories with the name of the respective surface adatom (specified at the bottom of the notebook with the "element" keyword).
